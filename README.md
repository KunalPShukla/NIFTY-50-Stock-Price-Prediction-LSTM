# NIFTY-50 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices for NIFTY-50 companies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, trend analysis, and model training to forecast stock prices accurately.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created technical indicators like RSI, Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Volatility, and Daily Returns.
- **LSTM Model**: Built and trained LSTM networks to predict stock prices, achieving low validation losses (0.0010–0.0099).
- **Visualization**: Analyzed stock trends, volatility, and performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio) across industries.
- **Top Stock Selection**: Trained models on top-performing stocks based on cumulative and daily returns.

## Key Results
- Achieved low validation losses (0.0010–0.0099) across multiple stocks.
- Predicted next-day open prices for top-performing stocks like MARUTI, SHREECEM, and BAJAJFINSV.
- Delivered actionable insights through trend analysis and performance metrics.
